🚨 73% of small businesses fail due to cash flow problems they didn't see coming.

I just launched Cash Flow Forecaster Pro to help entrepreneurs predict (and prevent) those devastating shortfalls before they happen.

Thread on why this matters 👇

The problem: You're profitable on paper but can't pay rent next month.

Sound familiar? Most small business owners manage cash flow in spreadsheets or... their head. By the time you realize there's a problem, it's often too late to fix it.

**Tweet 3:**
Cash Flow Forecaster Pro gives you:
• 13-week rolling forecasts
• Scenario planning ("What if I lose my biggest client?")
• Early warning alerts
• Visual cash flow timeline
• Integration with your existing accounting

Simple enough for non-accountants. Powerful enough to save your business.

**Tweet 4:**
At $89, it costs less than one bounced check fee or late payment penalty.

Compare that to the $10,000+ most businesses spend on emergency loans when cash flow surprises hit.

This is insurance for your business's lifeline.

If you've ever lost sleep wondering if you'll make payroll, this is for you.

**Running a small business without cash flow forecasting is like driving blindfolded.**

Three months ago, I watched a friend's profitable restaurant close because they couldn't predict a seasonal cash crunch. They had plenty of orders booked for later, but couldn't cover rent in the slow period.

That's when I realized: most small business owners are flying blind when it comes to cash flow. They know their monthly revenue, but they don't know if they'll be short $5,000 in week 3 of next month.

So I built Cash Flow Forecaster Pro.

It's designed for busy entrepreneurs who don't have time to become spreadsheet experts, but need to see around corners. 13-week rolling forecasts, scenario planning, and early warnings that actually give you time to act.

**Who this helps:**
• Service businesses with irregular payment cycles
• Retailers managing seasonal fluctuations  
• Any business owner who's ever worried about making payroll

The goal isn't perfect predictions—it's giving you enough runway to make smart decisions before problems become crises.

For anyone managing cash flow stress (or knows someone who is): [link]

Because your business deserves better than hoping the numbers work out.

**Title:** "Built a tool after watching too many profitable businesses fail due to cash flow surprises. Learned some hard lessons about forecasting."

**Body:**

Last year, I consulted for a small manufacturing company that was landing bigger contracts than ever. On paper, they were crushing it. 

Then they nearly went bankrupt.

The issue? Those big contracts had 60-90 day payment terms. Meanwhile, they had to pay suppliers upfront and cover payroll every two weeks. They were profitable but cash-poor, and by the time they realized it, they were scrambling for emergency funding.

This happens more than you'd think. **73% of small businesses cite cash flow as their biggest challenge**, yet most manage it reactively instead of proactively.

After seeing this pattern repeat with multiple clients, I built Cash Flow Forecaster Pro. It's basically a crystal ball for your bank account—showing you exactly when money comes in and goes out over the next 13 weeks.

**Key things I learned building this:**

1. Business owners don't need complex financial modeling—they need to see problems coming with enough time to fix them

2. The best forecasting tool is one you'll actually use (hence keeping it simple)

3. Scenario planning is crucial ("What if my biggest client pays 30 days late?")

It's helped the businesses I work with avoid overdraft fees, plan for equipment purchases, and most importantly—sleep better at night.

Still refining it based on user feedback, but wanted to share in case it helps anyone else dealing with cash flow stress: [link]

Anyone else have cash flow horror stories? Would love to hear how other entrepreneurs handle forecasting.

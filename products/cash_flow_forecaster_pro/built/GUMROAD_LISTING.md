## Why Cash Flow Planning Matters:

**82% of small business failures** are due to cash flow problems—not lack of profits. 

You can have a profitable business and still run out of cash if:
- Customers pay you slowly
- You grow too fast (hiring before revenue arrives)
- Seasonal slumps hit harder than expected
- Unexpected expenses pop up

**This forecaster helps you see problems months in advance** so you can:
- Start fundraising before you're desperate
- Time expenses better
- Plan hiring strategically
- Sleep better knowing what's coming
